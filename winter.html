    <h1>Benitha Sri Panchagiri does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h2>UNCLE VANYA ACT 2  - Anton Chekov</h2>

    <p class="speech">
      <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF.</h3>
      <p>Look for Batushka to-morrow morning; we used to have him, I
        remember. Why do I find it so hard to breathe?
    </p>
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
     <h3 class="HELENA">HELENA.</h3>
     <p>You are tired; this is the second night you have had no sleep.</p>
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF" >SEREBRAKOFF.</h3>
      <p>They say that Turgenieff got angina of the heart from gout.
        I am afraid I am getting angina too. Oh, damn this horrible, accursed
        old age! Ever since I have been old I have been hateful to myself, and I
        am sure, hateful to you all as well.</p>
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
        <h3 class="HELENA">HELENA.</h3>
        <p>You speak as if we were to blame for your being old.</p>
    </p> 

    <p class="speech">
        <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF.</h3>
        <p>I am more hateful to you than to any one.</p>
    </p> 

    <p class="direction"> HELENA gets up and walks away from him, sitting down at a distance.</p>

    <p class="speech">
        <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF.</h3>
        <p>You are quite right, of course. I am not an idiot; I can
            understand you. You are young and healthy and beautiful, and longing for
            life, and I am an old dotard, almost a dead man already. Don't I know
            it? Of course I see that it is foolish for me to live so long, but wait!
            I shall soon set you all free. My life cannot drag on much longer.
