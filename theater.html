    <h1>Benitha Sri Panchagiri does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h2>UNCLE VANYA ACT 2  - Anton Chekov</h2>

    <p>
        The dining-room of SEREBRAKOFF'S house. It is night. The tapping of the
        WATCHMAN'S rattle is heard in the garden. SEREBRAKOFF is dozing in an
        arm-chair by an open window and HELENA is sitting beside him, also half
        asleep.<br>

       <p> SEREBRAKOFF: <p>[Rousing himself]</p> Who is here? Is it you, Sonia?</p>

       <p>HELENA: It is I.</p>

       <p>SEREBRAKOFF: Oh, it is you, Nelly. This pain is intolerable.</p>

       <p>HELENA: Your shawl has slipped down. <p>[She wraps up his legs in the
        shawl]</p> Let me shut the window.</p>

        <p>SEREBRAKOFF: No, leave it open; I am suffocating. I dreamt just now that
        my left leg belonged to some one else, and it hurt so that I woke. <br>I
        don't believe this is gout, it is more like rheumatism. What time is it?</p>

        <p>HELENA: Half past twelve.<p>[A pause.]</p> 

        <p>SEREBRAKOFF: I want you to look for Batushka's works in the library
             tomorrow. I think we have him.</p>
