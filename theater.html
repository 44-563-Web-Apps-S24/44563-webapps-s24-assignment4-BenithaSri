    <h1>Benitha Sri Panchagiri does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h2>UNCLE VANYA ACT 2  - Anton Chekov</h2>

    <p>
        The dining-room of SEREBRAKOFF'S house. It is night. The tapping of the
        WATCHMAN'S rattle is heard in the garden. SEREBRAKOFF is dozing in an
        arm-chair by an open window and HELENA is sitting beside him, also half
        asleep.<br>

       <br> SEREBRAKOFF: [Rousing himself] Who is here? Is it you, Sonia?

       <br>HELENA: It is I.

       <br>SEREBRAKOFF: Oh, it is you, Nelly. This pain is intolerable.

       <br>HELENA: Your shawl has slipped down. [She wraps up his legs in the
        shawl] Let me shut the window.

        <br>SEREBRAKOFF: No, leave it open; I am suffocating. I dreamt just now that
        my left leg belonged to some one else, and it hurt so that I woke. <br>I
        don't believe this is gout, it is more like rheumatism. What time is it?

        <br>HELENA: Half past twelve. [A pause.]

        <br>SEREBRAKOFF: I want you to look for Batushka's works in the library
             tomorrow. I think we have him.
