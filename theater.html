    <h1>Benitha Sri Panchagiri does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h2>UNCLE VANYA ACT 2  - Anton Chekov</h2>

   
       <p class="direction"> The dining-room of SEREBRAKOFF'S house. It is night. The tapping of the
        WATCHMAN'S rattle is heard in the garden. SEREBRAKOFF is dozing in an
        arm-chair by an open window and HELENA is sitting beside him, also half
        asleep.</p>
    

       <p class="speech">
          <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF:</h3>
           <p>[Rousing himself] </p>
           Who is here? Is it you, Sonia?
       </p>

       <p class="speech">
         <h3 class="HELENA">HELENA:</h3>
          It is I.
        </p>

      <p class="speech">
          <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF:</h3>
           Oh, it is you, Nelly. This pain is intolerable.
        </p>

       <p class="speech">
          <h3 class="HELENA">HELENA:</h3> Your shawl has slipped down. 
          <p>[She wraps up his legs in theshawl]</p>
           Let me shut the window.
        </p>

        <p class="speech">
             <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF:</h3>  No, leave it open; I am suffocating. I dreamt just now that
            my left leg belonged to some one else, and it hurt so that I woke. <br>I
           don't believe this is gout, it is more like rheumatism. What time is it?
        </p>

        <p class="speech">
             <h3 class="HELENA">HELENA:</h3>  Half past twelve.
              <p> [A pause.]</p>
        </p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h3 class="SEREBRAKOFF">SEREBRAKOFF:</h3> I want you to look for Batushka's works in the library
            tomorrow. I think we have him.
